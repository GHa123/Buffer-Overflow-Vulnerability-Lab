# Buffer-Overflow-Vulnerability-Lab
This lab provides hands-on experience on buffer-overflow vulnerability. Buffer overflow is defined as the condition in which a program attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of pre-allocated fixed length buffers. This vulnerability can be used by a malicious user to alter the flow control of the program, leading to the execution of malicious code.
